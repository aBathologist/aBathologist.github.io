<h1 class="title">Reasons We Program: 1. How to Ask Why</h1>

</p>

<p>
This is two things simultaneously: First, it is a confession of the reasons I
program and of my motives for embracing or eschewing those reasons. Second, it
is a collection of remarks inquiring into the relation between reasoning and
programming in general. I hope it might be interesting to programmers and
non-programmers alike: <i>For the non-programmer</i>, it is intended as an
exposition of some of the thoughts and motives of a programming enthusiast,
and perhaps a seduction to try programming yourself. <i>For the programmer</i>,
working or playing, I have two aims in mind: first, an invitation to consider,
or reconsider, your own reasons and motives for programming; second, a request
for commentary or critique on the notions I've presented here.

<p>
These remarks are divided into three parts and the first two are prolegomna for
the third. The first clarifies what kind of question I mean to pose. The
second attempts to determine what I'm asking about. The third explores
some answers to the question determined through the preceding two:

<h2 id="orgheadline2"><a id="ID-270C129F-1AD8-4B33-8F0E-643E4DD305E5"></a>Rationale</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
In their forward to the famous <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs</i>, Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman suggest that a preoccupation with
the reasons for which particular programs are conceived obstructs insight into
the essential nature of programming itself:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Educators, generals, dieticians, psychologists, and parents program. Armies,
students, and some societies are programmed. An assault on large problems
employs a succession of programs, most of which spring into existence en
route. These programs are rife with issues that appear to be particular to the
problem at hand. To appreciate programming as an intellectual activity in its
own right you must turn to computer programming; you must read and write
computer programs &#x2013; many of them. It doesn't matter much what the programs
are about or what applications they serve. What does matter is how well they
perform and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation of still
greater programs. The programmer must seek both perfection of part and
adequacy of collection. In this book the use of ``program'' is focused on the
creation, execution, and study of programs written in a dialect of Lisp for
execution on a digital computer. Using Lisp we restrict or limit not what we
may program, but only the notation for our program descriptions. — <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-5.html">SICP</a>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The claims made here are bold and far reaching, and they reward reflection.
They claim that an understanding of the essential properties of the practice
of programming requires an analysis indifferent to any particular programs'
purpose. Moreover, the <i>computer program</i> is held above all other media as the
only medium in which the essential shape of the practice can be made apparent.
They claim that the computer is an unlimited programmatic tool, and that
anything programmable — from the personal and pedagogical to the globally
murderous — can be programmed on a digital computer in one particular dialect
of a single programming language.
</p>

<p>
I intend to consider the bases and implications of these claims in the course
of my remarks, but I believe them to be correct. When I say "I program" I mean
that I write and read computer programs. When I ask why we program, I mean to
inquire into the reasons we have for programming in the most general sense and
for any application. However, the nature of reason (understood in an
essentially Kantian sense) and the meaning of 'program' dictate that this
inquiry be essentially concerned with computation.

<h2 id="orgheadline3"><a id="ID-825B7445-6F13-4364-8037-D2F69B211315"></a>Essential reasons for programming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
What does this mean: "to have a reason for doing something"? When taken to be
a matter of motive, fitting answers take shape: money, pleasure, power,
status, edification, etc. Originally, <a href="http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=motive&amp;allowed_in_frame=0"><i>motive</i> was a matter of setting things
in motion</a> and these refracted reflections on reasons for programming <i>are</i>
modulated by the impulses that propel our intention — base and baseless alike.
But this kind of reason isn't the sort I'm interested in.
</p>

<p>
Like the impulses that set matter in motion, motivating inclinations are
contingent, <i>historical</i> components of organized action. Such inclinations are
produced by contingent, historical cognitions. Such cognitions tell us
something about the conditions and circumstances surrounding the action and
the actor but they don't reveal anything about the <i>fundamental</i> structures
that organize and sustain the circumstance:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If I abstract from all content of cognition, objectively considered, then all
cognition, considered subjectively, is either historical or rational.
Historical cognition is <i>cognitio ex datis</i>, rational cognition however,
<i>cognitio ex principiis</i>. However a cognition may have been given originally,
it is still historical for him who possesses it if he cognizes it only to the
degree and extent that it has been given to him from elsewhere, whether it
has been given to him through immediate experience or told to him or even
given to him through instruction … He has formed himself
according to an alien reason, but the faculty of imitation is not that of
generation, i.e., the cognition did not arise <b>from</b> reason for him, and
although objectively it was certainly a rational cognition, subjectively it
is still merely historical.
</p>

<p>
— Kant, <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suppose, as Abelson and the Sussmans claim, that computer programming stages
an encounter with the essential structure of programming and programmability.
Then computer programming would enable rational cognition of programming and
an understanding of the subject matter on the basis of its fundamental
principles, <i>cognitio ex principiis</i>. In contrast, experience with the
informal programs of the educator, general, and dietician would provide a
merely historical cognition of programming. The latter only gives us
understanding relative to the programmable domain that happens to be given in
the course of our practical experience. Such understanding, <i>cognitio ex
datis</i>, would be bound and determined by the contingencies of whatever we
were given, and it would be "rife with issues that appear to be particular to
the problem at hand".
</p>

<p>
But the same can be said of a reflexive understanding that seeks cognition of
the reasons for pursuing "programming as an intellectual activity in its own
right". If we settle for an account of the historical circumstances that
determined our practice, and fixate on a taxonomy of the extraneous desires
motivating our interest, we'll have a merely historical understanding of our
reasons for programming.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The historical approach, that seeks to eavesdrop on the becoming of things
and from becoming to know their essence, certainly carries great authority;
but it has also its limitations. If in the existing flux of all things there
is nothing fixed, eternity persists, then the knowability of the world would
end and everything would plummet into confusion. One thinks, as it appears,
that concepts in the individual mind emerge like the leaves on trees, and
believes that their nature could be recognized from this, that one explores
and seeks to define their emergence psychologically from the nature of the
human mind. But this conception pushes everything into the subjective, and if
pursued to the end, annihilates truth. What one calls the history of concepts
is rather either a history of our knowledge of concepts or of the meanings of
words.
</p>

<p>
— Frege, <i>The Foundations of Arithmetic</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I <i>will</i> note some highlights in the historical determination of my (and our)
preoccupation with programming, but these reflections on why we program aim to
remark essential features of the relation between instrumental reason and
computer programming. The grounding principle from which this understanding
struggles to take shape is the inherent correspondence between the basic
nature of calculative reason, formalized in computation, and the essentially
programmatic nature of all instrumentation. At the same time, while I find
Frege's platonic apology for conceptual eternality evocative, the computable
is accurately (though neither precisely nor clearly) describable as the domain
in which constructable conceptualization seizes hold of its own historical
determination.
