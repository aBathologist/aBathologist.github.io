<blockquote>
<p>
Educators, generals, dieticians, psychologists, and parents program. Armies,
students, and some societies are programmed. An assault on large problems
employs a succession of programs, most of which spring into existence en route.
These programs are rife with issues that appear to be particular to the problem
at hand. To appreciate programming as an intellectual activity in its own right
you must turn to computer programming; you must read and write computer programs
…

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
<b>What this is:</b> A confession of the reasons I program and of my motives for embracing or
eschewing those reasons.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why this is:</b> <i>For the non-programmer</i>, it is an exposition of some of the
thoughts and motives of a programming enthusiast, and perhaps a seduction to
try programming yourself. <i>For the programmer</i>, working or playing, I have two
aims in mind:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An invitation to consider, or reconsider, your own reasons and motives for programming.</li>
<li>A request for commentary or critique on the notions I've presented here.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="orgheadline2"><a id="ID-270C129F-1AD8-4B33-8F0E-643E4DD305E5"></a>On rationale</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
What does this mean: "to have a reason for doing something"? When we take this
to be a matter of motive, fitting answers take shape:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>money</li>
<li>pleasure</li>
<li>power</li>
<li>status</li>
<li>edification</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>Motive</i> was a matter of setting things in motion:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
mid-14c., "something brought forward," from Old French <i>motif</i> "will, drive,
motivation," noun use of adjective, literally "moving," from Medieval Latin
<i>motivus</i> "moving, impelling," from Latin <i>motus</i> "a moving, motion," past
participle of <i>movere</i> "to move". Meaning "that which inwardly
moves a person to behave a certain way" is from early 15c.
</p>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These refracted reflections on my reasons for programming are modulated by the
impulses that direct my intention — base and baseless alike. But this kind
of <i>reason</i> isn't the one I'm really interested in.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline3"><a id="ID-925F3F8A-F4DB-4146-96DB-7D6AF1EE7942"></a>Historical and rational cognition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
Like the impulses that set matter in motion, motivating inclinations are
contingent, <i>historical</i> components of organized action. Such inclinations
are produced by contingent, historical cognitions. These tell us something
about the conditions and circumstances surrounding the action and the actor
but they don't reveal anything about the <i>fundamental</i> structures that
organize and sustain the circumstance.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If I abstract from all content of cognition, objectively considered, then all
cognition, considered subjectively, is either historical or rational.
Historical cognition is <i>cognitio ex datis</i>, rational cognition however,
<i>cognitio ex principiis</i>. However a cognition may have been given originally,
it is still historical for him who possesses it if he cognizes it only to the
degree and extent that it has been given to him from elsewhere, whether it
has been given to him through immediate experience or told to him or even
given to him through instruction (general cognitions) … He has formed himself
according to an alien reason, but the faculty of imitation is not that of
generation, i.e., the cognition did not arise <b>from</b> reason for him, and
although objectively it was certainly a rational cognition, subjectively it
is still merely historical.
</p>

<p>
— Kant, <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suppose, as Abelson and the Sussmans claim, that computer programming stages
an encounter with the essential structure of programming and programmability.
Then computer programming would enable rational cognition of programming and
an understanding of the subject matter on the basis of its fundamental
principles, <i>cognitio ex principiis</i>. In contrast, experience with the
informal programs of the educator, general, and dietician would provide a
merely historical cognition of programming. The latter only gives us
understanding relative to the programmable domain that happens to be given in
the course of our practical experience. Such understanding, <i>cognitio ex
datis</i>, would be bound and determined by the contingencies of whatever we
were given, and it would be would be "rife with issues that appear to be
particular to the problem at hand".
</p>

<p>
But the same can be said of reflexive understanding that seeks cognition of
the reasons for pursuing "programming as an intellectual activity in its own
right". If we settle for an account of the historical circumstances that
determined our practice, and fixate on a taxonomy of the extraneous desires
that motivate our interest, we'll have merely historical understanding of our
reasons for programming.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
The historical approach, that seeks to eavesdrop on the becoming of things
and from becoming to know their essence, certainly carries great authority;
but it has also its limitations. If in the existing flux of all things there
is nothing fixed, eternity persists, then the knowability of the world would
end and everything would plummet into confusion. One thinks, as it appears,
that concepts in the individual mind emerge like the leaves on trees, and
believes that their nature could be recognized from this, that one explores
and seeks to define their emergence psychologically from the nature of the
human mind. But this conception pushes everything into the subjective, and if
pursued to the end, annihilates truth. What one calls the history of concepts
is rather either a history of our knowledge of concepts or of the meanings of
words. 
</p>

<p>
— Frege, <i>The Foundations of Arithmetic</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I <i>will</i> note some highlights in the historical determination of my
preoccupation with programming, but these reflections on why we program aim
to remark essential features of the relation between instrumental reason and
computer programming. The grounding principle from which this understanding
struggles to take shape is the inherent correspondence between the basic
nature of calculative reason, formalized in computation, and the essentially
programmatic nature of all instrumentation.
